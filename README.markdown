#	Code and Coffee collaboration project 

Zambia is a Rails 3 website created to organize Code and Coffee meetups.

Code and Coffee is an informal get together with the idea of getting out of bed early, hitting a coffee shop, and writing some code with fellow geeks for as long as you can stay. There are no requirements other than the willingness to sit down, pair up, and learn something new.

Its grassroots beginnings started in Columbus, OH and the Code and Coffee movement has since spread via Twitter to other cities, such as Cincinnati, Indianapolis and South Bend.
